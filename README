To recover last git commit you have done use this command

1. git reflog (it will show the latest commits)

sample:
26e4dc2 (HEAD -> main) HEAD@{0}: commit: Changed Tracking
eba45a3 HEAD@{1}: commit (initial): Dashboard (Home Done)

2. git reset --hard eba45a3 (this ill recover what commit has did you put on this argument)
